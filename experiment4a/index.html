				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This was the first of three infinite world generators I worked on with my partner, Connor. The program generates a chess board with some variation in colors, and when the user clicks on any tile, a random chess piece will be generated. If the tile clicked was white, it will generate a black piece and if it was black it will generate a white piece. Additionally, when a chess piece is generated, it will splash some color on the board around where it was drawn.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>For the board generation, we simply made a grid pattern, and added brightness adjustments to the black tiles to make it seem more randomly generated between each seed. For spawning in the chess pieces, we created a function that randomly picks between the chess pieces, and made it detect what tile it was being placed on to change its color to black or white. For the splash of color, we made a function that pulses randomly generated colors around the selected tile radius. With the variables we created, we can also control the pulse speed and the radius.</p>
			</div>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This was the first board we created when working on this assignment. Because of this, we wanted to create something simple to help teach us the basics. Although we was satisfied when we first finished working on this generator, I think we could have added more features to make it interesting. Maybe we could have made a functional chess game or added more variations to the board. However, I am happy with how this generator taught us about the basics and allowed our next generators to be more interesting.</p>
