				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This infinite generator generates a grid of tiles with varying shades of blue to represent an ocean. The grid is affected by wave-like patterns that propagate across the tiles, creating a dynamic and visually appealing effect. The program generates new waves at regular intervals, which create rippling effects on the tiles.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>The code uses the p5.js library for rendering the visuals. It defines several constants and variables to control the wave propagation speed, dissipation rate, maximum wave distance, and maximum wave duration. The p3_drawTile function is responsible for rendering each tile, calculating the wave effect, and applying displacement based on the wave propagation. The sinAt function is a helper function used for calculating the wave amplitude. The generateNewWave function creates a new wave at a random position on the grid.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Overall, I am pretty happy with how this generator turned out. The colors we used for the ocean environment are very appealing and the wave generation effect is satisfying to look at. One thing we could have added is fish that appear in the water on certain tiles that move with the waves, but we felt that this wave generation alone was interesting enough for one of our infinite generators.</p>
