				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>The goal of this experiment was to learn how to use p5.js to create a generated landscape made from a tileset. The assignment included having to create two separate environments, a dungeon and an overworld.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>I used p5.js alongside a provided tileset in order to create randomly generated environments. By selecting the tiles I wanted to see, designing the interactions between them, and using functions like noise I was able to get my desired output. Then, I made sure that the landscape was randomly generated each time by adding elements that would be different each time the user presses the reseed button.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This experiment was easily the most difficult one for me, by far. I have never used a tileset before in p5.js so I came into this assignment knowing absolutely nothing and no idea where to begin. The main difficulties for me included corner tiles, animating tiles, and overall just working with a tileset. Additionally, putting both drawings on one page proved to be a challenge. I had to consult some friends on their ideas in order to get mine to work.</p>
