				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This project generates ad lib narratives. It was created on glitch.com and its purpose was to familiarize me with the glitch and the portfolio page.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>The project generates the sentence by rasndomly selecting variable elements from predefined arrays. It uses these to construct unique sentences each generation. I swapped all of the variables that were in the predefined arrays and changed the example sentence that was provided.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>The project was not too difficult to get a hang of and now that I know how to do it, it will be way easier in future projects. The only part I struggled with was transferring the code from Glitch.com to github. Coding, committing, and seeing the changes was easy and intuitive from past classes.</p>
