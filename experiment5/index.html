				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>The goal of this programming project was to create a generator that uses different shapes to try to mimic an image. The image mutates itself a certain amount based on the mutation slider to try and get closer and closer to the image provided.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>The initialize function creates an array of shape objects, where each shape's color is sampled from the corresponding pixel of the inspiration image. In render, the shapes are drawn on the canvas based on the selected shape type. The mutate function mutates the properties of each shape by sampling new colors from the inspiration image based on the shape's new position. This process creates an abstract representation of the inspiration image using colored shapes.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I'm pretty happy with how the project turned out. I think there can definitely be improvements made to how the shapes are mutated, but I think it's very visually fascinating. The way shapes are mutated adds a satisfying dynamic quality to the art.</p>
